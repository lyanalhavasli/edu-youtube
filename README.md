# My ChatGpt Usage Data Analysis DSA 210 Project
## Description
This project focuses on analyzing my ChatGPT usage, leveraging data exported from ChatGPT in JSON format. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and trends in my interactions with ChatGPT, offering insights into my usage behavior. Through visualizations and statistical analyses, the project explores the frequency and timing of queries across different days of the week and hours of the day, examines query distribution among various ChatGPT model versions, and investigates relationships between conversation lengths and the time spent on them. Bar charts, scatter plots, and other visual tools are used to highlight these patterns, while statistical tests, such as chi-square tests and correlation analyses, validate the findings.
